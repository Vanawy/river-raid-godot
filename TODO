Todo:
  ✔ Create and animate a jet fighter. The screen will scroll vertically, and the jet can move side to side. The player can accelerate or brake, which will change the vertical scrolling speed.
  ✔ Add a river bank on both sides of the level. The river can vary in size, or even split into two streams. Hitting the river bank will kill the player. 
  ✔ Divide the game into levels. Between levels, the river will narrow, and there will be a bridge crossing it. Bridges act as checkpoints. The player must shoot the bridge, colliding with it will kill the player. 
  ☐ Add some enemies! Boats and helicopters will move back and forth across the river. Jets will cross the entire screen. Colliding with an enemy will kill the player.
    ✔ Jets flying on each level @done(24-04-25 13:26) 
    ✔ Jets flying in formation @done(24-08-25 13:59)
    ✔ Some variation to jets movement @done(24-08-20 19:13)
    ☐ Boats patroling river
    ✔ Some boats spawn with AA @done(24-08-23 00:38)
    ☐ AA on river banks
  ☐ Add fuel depots. Flying over these will replenish the player's fuel reserves. The player can shoot and destroy fuel depots, but colliding with them doesn't kill the player.
  ☐ Add a UI with a life counter, score, and fuel gauge. 
  ☐ The fuel gauge will drain slowly, and the player will die if it reaches “empty”
  ✔ Give the player the ability to shoot things! @done(24-08-23 00:40)
  ☐ Shooting things increases the player score.


Stretch:
  ✔ Not sure how to make the game infinitely long? The easy way would be to create multiple hand-crafted levels that start and end with a bridge. The fun way would be to generate the levels dynamically on the fly.
  ☐ The Atari 2600 could only display limited sprites. Modern computers are capable of creating massive particle effect explosions. You know what to do 😉
