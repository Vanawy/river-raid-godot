Todo:
  ✔ Create and animate a jet fighter. The screen will scroll vertically, and the jet can move side to side. The player can accelerate or brake, which will change the vertical scrolling speed.
  ✔ Add a river bank on both sides of the level. The river can vary in size, or even split into two streams. Hitting the river bank will kill the player. 
  ✔ Divide the game into levels. Between levels, the river will narrow, and there will be a bridge crossing it. Bridges act as checkpoints. The player must shoot the bridge, colliding with it will kill the player. 
  ✔ Add some enemies! Boats and helicopters will move back and forth across the river. Jets will cross the entire screen. Colliding with an enemy will kill the player. @done(24-08-25 21:11)
    ✔ Jets flying on each level @done(24-04-25 13:26) 
    ✔ Jets flying in formation @done(24-08-25 13:59)
    ✔ Some variation to jets movement @done(24-08-20 19:13)
    ✔ Boats patroling river @done(24-08-25 21:11)
    ✔ Some boats spawn with AA @done(24-08-23 00:38)
    ✘ AA on river banks @cancelled(24-08-25 20:50)

  ✔ Add a UI with a life counter, score, and fuel gauge. @done(24-08-30 13:31)
    ✔ Difficulty UI @done(24-08-30 13:31)
    ✔ Score UI @done(24-08-27 22:54)
    ✘ The fuel gauge will drain slowly, and the player will die if it reaches “empty” @cancelled(24-08-29 21:34)

  ✔ AA shoots more rockets on higher difficulty @done(24-08-25 22:00)
  ✘ Add fuel depots. Flying over these will replenish the player's fuel reserves. The player can shoot and destroy fuel depots, but colliding with them doesn't kill the player. @cancelled(24-08-29 21:34)
  ✔ Give the player the ability to shoot things! @done(24-08-23 00:40)
  ✔ Shooting things increases the player score. @done(24-08-27 22:54)

  ✔ Flares fixes @done(24-08-30 13:49)
    ✔ Confuse multiple rockets with single flare launch @done(24-08-30 13:49)
    ☐ Flares auto launch toggle
    ✔ FIx bug when flares aren't launching if rocket enters area before flare became available @done(24-08-30 13:49)


Stretch:
  ✔ Not sure how to make the game infinitely long? The easy way would be to create multiple hand-crafted levels that start and end with a bridge. The fun way would be to generate the levels dynamically on the fly.
  ☐ The Atari 2600 could only display limited sprites. Modern computers are capable of creating massive particle effect explosions. You know what to do 😉
